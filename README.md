_First of all, English is not my mother tongue, so sorry in advance for any mistakes._

## The Dream
_This library is the first step in a bigger dream._  
_One day, I thought to myself that there weren't enough people on my TrinityCore server (i was alone)._   
_I could have invited my friends to join me, but I don't have many and they aren't as geeky as I am._   
_I could have invited strangers to join me, but I should have spent time administering the server, chatting, maybe even organizing events, in short, I didn't have the courage or the inclination._  
_So I decided to create the players for my server (mainly to have fun and see what I can do)._  
_This library is therefore a piece of a bot system for TrinityCore, a system that will see the light of day in a long time or never._   
_Have a nice day_
